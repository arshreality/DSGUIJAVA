/*******************************************************************
* GUI Application for implementation of data structures and the time efficiency
* 
* Manual:
* 1. Initialize a list by entering information in the top text box and press Add to store that number in the list
* 2. Choose a data structure to store all the integers entered.
* 3. Choose function(s) and enter an integer in the second text box which can be used to add or remove or find that integer in any data structure chosen, the code takes care of the every data structure  
* 4. The algorithm used for searching is binary search which is the most efficient algorithm.
* 5. Every operation throws a message which displays the time used in carrying out that operation. 
* 6. The Selection Sort button sorts the list and displays it alongside the time elapsed. This can be used to how different data structrues have a different efficiency even if they use the same algorithm for sorting. 
* 7. It is recommended that the user presses the Clear All button to start over.
